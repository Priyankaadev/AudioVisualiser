Here are some of the things which we used in this project: 
No of Chanels -> Each channel consist of a separate data.
In this project, we have 2 channels -> left and right channel
Sample Rate -> ex-48000 samples as in this project meaning 48000 sample of audio per second.
When we Hear music, because of audio signals and when we want to work with the audio, it can be converted from analog data to digital data using the method of PCM, which is Pulse Code Modulation.
Next we used FFT, which is Fast Fourier Transformation to visualize the bar graph in motion. FFT is a mathematical concept, it converts complex signal from time based into frequency based format.
